# hi 
 this is my microsoft mandated personal introduction page
## I am a student learning how to code, which I hope to make a career out of.

I want to learn python, lua, javascript and the C languages.

*I don't have much to write about for now.. but I wish to learn and use github as a tool to do so!*
